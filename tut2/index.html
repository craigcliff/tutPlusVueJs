Vue Js does not at runtime use HTML code and has these commands at run time. 

Vue JS creates template based on HTML code and uses html code to be rendered in DOM.

Data stored in vue data object can be output just as is, without using "this".

Can execute function in curly braces - needs to something that can be converted to a string

WE have access to everything stored in data and methods properties.

By calling "this" in methods, can access data properties through methods.

Cant use curly braces in any http element attributes - can only use curly braces in text elements

v-bind tells JS to not use normal attributes, instead to bind attributes. Binds data dynamically

A directive is an instruction you place in your code, like v-bind.  for cases you cant use double brace, use directives.

v-once allows the value of a property to stick to the initial value and not change if property value changes at a later stage.

By default VUEJS doesnt render HTML content, unless using v-html.

Can parse even objects automatically eg, V-on click update Coordinates.

Use $event to pass automatically created object

 v-on:mousemove.stop : stops propagation of event of parent element
v-on:mousemove.prevents : prevents default behaviour
 v-on:keyup.enter - listen to specific key events
 
 Within the DivID="app", we can write javascript directly in the {{}}, aslong as its not if or for statements.
 
 v-model allows for 2way data binding : bellow example updates the data property and whereever the data property is specified
 
 Data property is not reactive - need to use methods or computed.
 Known options for VUE instance:  El: connects to Dom
                                  data: Store data to be used
                                  methods: methods of the Vue instance
                                  computed: Dependant properties
                                  
Computed allows us to store properties
Call computed objects the same as you would with data properties - with {{}}
Everything stored in computed can be used as you would in data property.
Computed properties doesnt get executed all the time, like methods do.
only use methods if you dont want to cache results - you want to update or recalculate dom all the time.
computed objects are more optimal

An alternative computed property: watch object (execute code upon data changes)
 Computed property runs syncronously.  If you need to run assyncronously, need to use watch.
